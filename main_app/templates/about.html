<p class="about_p"><font size= "5"> * Psilocybin Therapy:
    Also known as psilocybin-assisted therapy, involves the use of a psychedelic compound that is native to a specific type of mushroom in a psychotherapeutic setting. These “magic” fungi outperformed common prescription medicines and widely used antidepressants in easing the symptoms of major depression. However, these "shrooms" remain controversial and stigmatized.</font>

<hr />
<p><font size= "5">DISCLAIMER: Magic mushroom legality varies from country to country. According to certain laws, mushrooms are categorised into constituent parts:

    1. Mushroom (fruiting body)
    2. Mycelium
    3. Spores.
    
    In some countries, such as the Netherlands, the law treats these parts differently. For instance, spores and mycelium (and truffles) are legal—which is why it is legal to sell mushroom grow kits—but the mushroom fruiting bodies themselves are illegal.
    
    So, before purchasing, growing, or picking, check the laws in your own country!
