# "Caps n' Stems": strictly informational

 Nearly three years ago, Denver decriminalized psilocybin, an effort that cracked open the door to a medicine, experts say treats everything from cancer, alcoholism, and smoking cigareetes, to depression and end-of-life anxiety. However, it’s still a schedule 1 drug, and the Drug Policy Alliance reps claim to citing the general public's views of psychedelics as extremely dangerous — close to drugs like crack cocaine, heroin, and meth. As hallucinogens and psychedelics get a renewed look by researchers, they're finding that the substances may improve almost anyone's mood and quality of life — as long as they're taken in the right setting, typically a controlled environment, or through the new phenomenom of microdosing, which is practiced by anyone from pro-athletes to yoga moms. While the studies are new and ongoing, and a national regulatory model for legal psychedelics and hallucinogens is practically nonexistent, the available research is very promising — enough to reconsider the demonization and prohibition of these potentially amazing drugs. This web app was designed to provide a neutral informational community-based blog platform, people involved or interested in this controversial topic would be able to create, read, update, and delete their collection of information about different shrooms they have come across.

# What did I learn?

How to use Python, psql and Django to build a CRUD application.

# Biggest challenge:

1. Deployment to Heroku and control flow with github.
2. Trying to figure out Materialize.
3. Trying to understand how migrations work.
4. Salvaging project after switching databases.
5. Did I mention deployment?

# Future ideas:

Better styling and providing users in the community to add media and blog posts. No commenting due to the polarity of opinions on this topic, admin regulations may need to be enforced frequently. Maintain neutral platform thats informational not so much promotional are persuanding. A news tracker on the updates and trends in the culture of health and wellness via natural remedies as well as the legality status updates globally.
