# "Caps-n-Stems": strictly informational

 Nearly three years ago, Denver decriminalized psilocybin, an effort that cracked open the door to a medicine experts say treats everything from depression to end-of-life anxiety. However, it’s still a schedule 1 drug and the Drug Policy Alliance reps claim to citing the general public's views of psychedelics as extremely dangerous — close to drugs like crack cocaine, heroin, and meth. As hallucinogens and psychedelics get a renewed look by researchers, they're finding that the substances may improve almost anyone's mood and quality of life — as long as they're taken in the right setting, typically a controlled environment. And while the studies are new and ongoing, and a national regulatory model for legal hallucinogens is practically nonexistent, the available research is very promising — enough to reconsider the demonization and prohibition of these potentially amazing drugs.
